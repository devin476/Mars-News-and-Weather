# Mars News and Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves web scraping and data analysis focused on Mars. It consists of two main parts: scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles, and scraping and analyzing Mars weather data. The skills applied in this project include HTML element identification, web scraping using Splinter and Beautiful Soup, and data analysis and visualization using Pandas.

## Deliverables
- **Deliverable 1**: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- **Deliverable 2**: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, presented in a table format.

## Files
- `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for scraping Mars news.
- `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.
- `mars_weather_data.csv`: CSV file containing the Mars weather data.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
This part involves using Splinter for automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and extract the titles and preview text of news articles. The results are stored in a list of dictionaries, each containing a title and preview text.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
This section focuses on scraping Mars weather data from an HTML table using Beautiful Soup. The data is then analyzed to answer several questions about Martian weather, such as identifying the coldest and warmest months on Mars and examining atmospheric pressure variations. The analysis includes data visualizations and is exported to a CSV file for further use.

## Analysis Questions
- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian days' worth of data are in the dataset?
- What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars?
- Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
- How many terrestrial days are in a Martian year?

## Results and Discussion
The results of the analysis are discussed in detail in the Jupyter Notebooks. Key findings include a summary of results.
